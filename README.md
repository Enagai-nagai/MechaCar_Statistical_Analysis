## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Results and Summary
* The below is the statistical summary of the multiple linear regression where the mpg is the dependant variable and the rest of 5 factors (vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, AWD) are the independant variables.
* According to the result, intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance are the variables seem to have a significant impact on the mpg.
* The impact that AWD and spoiler_angle have on the mpg is quite limited.
* The R squared value is 0.6825, which means that this multiple linear regression can explain 68% of the number of mpg. Besides, p-value of this model is much smaller than 0.05 so we can say that this model is not random.
